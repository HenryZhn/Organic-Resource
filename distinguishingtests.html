						Solubility Test
					</h3>
					<hr>
					<h3>
						Description
					</h3>
					<ul>
						<li>
							The solubility test isolates compounds that are insoluble in a given solvent, usually water. 
						</li>
						<li>
							This test is performed by attempting to mix/dissolve compounds into solution. Misible compounds will dissolve into solution, while the imicible/insolube compounds will not, instead forming a seperate layer.
						</li>
						<li>
							Water insoluble organic compounds will often float on top of water, although there are exceptions to this, such as halogenated compounds.
						</li>
						<li>
							Only polar molecules with a chain of 5 or less carbons are soluble in water, so everything else is usually insoluble and will form seperate layer/s.
						</li>
					</ul>
					<h3>
						List of molecules and their response to a solubility test with water
					</h3>
					<ul>
						<li>
							Alkanes: Non-polar, therefore insoluble in water.
						</li>
						<li>
							Alkanes: Non-polar, therefore insoluble in water.
						</li>
						<li>
							Haloalkanes: Polar due to the temporary dipole created by the halogen. Soluble as long as carbon chain does not excede 5 carbons.
						</li>
						<li>
							Alcohols: Polar due to the temporary dipole created by the hydroxyl group. Soluble as long as carbon chain does not excede 5 carbons.
						</li>
						<li>
							Ketones: Polar due to the temporary dipole created by the double bonded oxygen. Soluble as long as carbon chain does not excede 5 carbons.
						</li>
						<li>
							Aldehydes: Polar due to the temporary dipole created by the double bonded oxygen. Soluble as long as carbon chain does not excede 5 carbons.
						</li>
						<li>
							Carboxylic Acids: Polar due to the temporary dipole created by the double bonded oxygen and the hydroxyl group. Soluble as long as carbon chain does not excede 5 carbons.
						</li>
						<li>
							Esters: Virtually insoluble in water, and will instead undergo hydrolysis.
						</li>
						<li>
							Acid Chlorides: Will react with water to produce while hydrochloric acid fumes.
						</li>
						<li>
							Amines: Polar due to the temporary dipole created by the amine functional group. Soluble as long as carbon chain does not excede 5 carbons.
						</li>
						<li>
							Amides: Polar due to the temporary dipole created by the amide functional group. Soluble as long as carbon chain does not excede 5 carbons.

						Water Test
					</h3>
					<hr>
					<h3>
						Description
					</h3>
					<ul>
						<li>
							The water test can be used to distinguish compounds that may or may not react with water.
						</li>
						<li>
							The compounds are mixed with water and observed for any reactions. This can be done simultaneously to a solubility test for obvious reasons.
						</li>
					</ul>
					<h3>
						Distinguished Compounds
					</h3>
					<ul>
						<li>
							Esters: Esters will undergo hydrolysis when mixed with water under either acidic or basic conditions, basically disappearing. However, if the water is neutral (pH=7), the two will be in equilibrium, with equal amounts ester dissociating into carboxylic acid and alcohol and esters being formed. However, this should be able to be tested for with a litmus test.
